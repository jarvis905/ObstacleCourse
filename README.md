Game Name

Obstacle Maze

Description

Obstacle Maze is a fun 3D game that blends action and adventure in a fantastical setting. You take on the role of a character on a quest through two challenging stages chock-full of traps. Finding a unique "Green Glowing Disc" at the end of the maze, which signifies victory, is your major objective. You must walk cautiously to avoid potentially harmful obstacles like Patrollers, Shooters, and Wanderers if you want to win. You lose if you run into them or make a mistake. You'll need to use quick reflexes and dexterity to avoid projectiles from shooters, and moving patrollers as you advance through the levels which are encircled by walls. With amazing sound effects that add to the game's realism, it becomes even more thrilling.

Enemies

There are 3 types of enemies:

1. Shooters: Shooter cannons are placed throughout the maze that shoot projectiles at varying speeds and distances.
1. Patrollers: Patrollers are enemies that traverse repeatedly over a predefined path. They are placed throughout the maze to block the player from moving forward to the goal.
1. Wanderers: Wanderers are patrollers that follow unpredictable and erratic movement patterns in a fixed area. They are placed throughout Level 2 for increased difficulty as you move ahead in the game.
